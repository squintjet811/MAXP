# MAXP
This is a simple guide how to access Max+ without having wechat
# Introduction
MAX+ is a Chinese app which focuses on cyber games and game related topics.  <br/>
Recently MAX+ added a feature to trade CSGO ingame skin with a competitive convenience fee(1%).  <br/>
The purpose of this guide is to help non-Chinese users to access p2p trading features on MAX+.  <br/>
Most of max+ features are embedded which means you can access it from another app.  <br/>
Today I am going to show you a magic trick to bypass Max+ with another app(which is developed from the same parent company as Max+) to unlock most of its features. <br/>

## Download
Instead of downloading Max+ app directly. You need to search for an app called [Xiaoheihe](https://www.xiaoheihe.cn/home). 
It is the same company who developed MAX+.

Why not directly download MAX+ : 
> The MAX+ App currently does not support international mobile number register while xiaoheihe does

## Login
There are two options to login to Xiaoheihe. <br/>
It is recommended to directly use your mobile number.<br/>
Simply click the grey syntax on your mobile.<br/>

Fill in your mobile number then type the SMS code you got. <br/>
